# Animal Crossing Toolkit

## Critter helper

The Animal Crossing UI doesn't make it very easy to figure out what critters that you still need to catch. This section helps you do that by letting you know what is available right now.

You can change the following settings:

- Hemisphere
- Active/Inactive
- Critter Type (bugs, fish, sea creatures or all of them)
- Filter donated
